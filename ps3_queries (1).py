#
# For each problem, use a text editor to add the appropriate SQL
# command between the triple quotes provided for that problem's variable.
#
# For example, here is how you would include a query that finds the
# names and years of all movies in the database with an R rating:
#
sample = """
    SELECT name, year
    FROM Movie
    WHERE rating = 'R';
"""

#
# Problem 1. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
# Follow the same format as the model query shown above.
#
problem1 = """

"""

#
# Problem 2. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
#
problem2 = """

"""

#
# Problem 3. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
#
problem3 = """

"""

#
# Problem 4. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
#
problem4 = """

"""

#
# Problem 5. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
#
problem5 = """

"""

#
# Problem 6. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
#
problem6 = """

#
# Problem 7. Put your SQL command between the triple quotes found below.
